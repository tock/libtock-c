/*
 * This module allows the client to initiate alarms and receive
 * callbacks when those alarms have expired. Clients can set one-shot alarms to
 * fire at particular clock values (`libtock_alarm_at`) or periodic alarms
 * (`libtock_alarm_repeating_every_ms`)
 *
 * The client should not assume anything about the underlying clock used by an
 * implementation other than that it is running at sufficient frequency to
 * deliver at least millisecond granularity and that it is a 32-bit clock (i.e.
 * it will wrap at 2^32 clock ticks).
