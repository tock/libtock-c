/** \brief Checks if `now` is between `reference` and `dt`, meaning
 *  the alarm has not yet expired.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * 1. `now` hasn't wrapped `reference`, i.e., in an infinite space,
 *    `now` - `reference` <= MAX_TICKS
 * 2. `dt` is at most MAX_TICKS, such that `reference + dt` at most
 *     wraps back to `reference`.
 * 3. `now` happens after `reference`, so if `now` is not "within"
 *    `reference` and `dt`, it is after, not before.
 * 4. `now` may be larger or smaller than `reference` since ticks
 *    wrap.
 *
 * Corrolaries:
 * - if `now` is larger than `reference`, `now - reference` is
 *   directly comparable to `dt` (1 & 2)
 * - if `now` is less than reference, `now - reference` wraps, and is
 * - comparable to `dt` because `now` is guaranteed to happened after
 *   `reference` (3)
 *
 * The result is that the check is fairly simple, but its simplicitly
 * relies specifically on `now` never happening before `reference`,
 * and thus tied to the specific logic in `alarm_upcall` (see inline
 * comment on delaying executing callbacks until after checking all
 * outstanding alarms).

 *
 * This upcall checks the ordered list of outstanding alarms for
 * expired alarms, removes them from the list, and invokes their
 * callbacks.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * 1. The list of outstanding alarms is ordered by absolute expiration time.
 * 2. The alarm event that invoked this upcall is for the current `head` of the list.
 * 3. No alarms are added (or re-added) to the list between while
 *    iterating through alarms
 * 4. For each alarm, `alarm->dt < MAX_TICKS + 1`
 *
 * Corrollaries:
 * - If the head of the list hasn't expired, no alarms in the tail of
 *   the list have expired (1)
 * - `scheduled` happens after `head->reference` (2)
 * - `scheduled` happens before `head->reference + MAX_TICKS + 1` (4)
 * - For each alarm in the list, `now` happens after
 *   `alarm->reference` (2, 3)
 * - For each alarm, `scheduled` cannot have cannot have wrapped
 *   `alarm->reference` (1, 4)
 * - For each alarm, if `scheduled` and `now` are not on the same side of
 *   `alarm->reference`, the alarm must have expired (1, 4)
 *
 * Critically, this upcall cannot allow any alarms to be added to the
 * ordered list while iterating by invoking upcalls, as that could
 * violate invariant (3) and result in `now` happening before some
 * `alarm->reference`.
 *
 * Some alarms that expire between `now` and the end of the upcall may
 * be "missed", which may mean they are delivered later. They should
 * still show up first in the list at the end, so will fire next.
