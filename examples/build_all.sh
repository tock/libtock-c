# Sentinel flag to indicate to apps that a `build all` is running.
#
# Generally, apps should not be sensitive to this flag. Build all is
# usually only invoked by a user when they're looking for local, CI-like
# behavior. However, a local repo checkout is not quite the same as a
# pristine CI environment, and certain test apps may need slightly
# different behavior for a local "build all" versus CI.
#
# For example: Some apps, e.g. LoRa-based ones, require radio
# configuration that end users *must* set themselves [e.g. to select
# operating region]. For users of these apps, we *do not* want them to
# build successfully 'out of the box' without explicit user
# intervention, but we do still want them to be compile-tested in CI. An
# app may ship with a `radioConfig_example.h` but include (and
# `.gitignore`) `radioConfig.h`.  CI can unconditionally swap in the
# `_example` version, but a local checkout should use a real config file
# it is available. At the same time, apps which are not used in a local
# checkout should not throw compile errors for a local "build all", and
# should thus swap in the `_example` if a real config is not present. An
# app build which is sensitive to `TOCK_BUILDALL` can capture this
# subtlety.
