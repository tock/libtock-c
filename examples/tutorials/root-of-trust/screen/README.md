Hardware Root of Trust (HWRoT) Demo Screen Application
------------------------------------------------------

This application implements the backbone of the hardware root of trust (HWRoT)
demo. It provides an application which drives an OLED screen, allowing

* the user to manually select a HWRoT service to take control of the device
* the selected HWRoT service to log to the screen once selected

This is part of a tutorial which improves the application in multiple steps. A
writeup for the tutorial is available at https://book.tockos.org/.
