Hardware Root of Trust (HWRoT) "Quesitonable" Kernel Attack Application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This application implements a denial of service attack on the encryption service
involving a "fault all applications" driver in the Hardware Root of Trust demo.

This is part of a tutorial which improves the encryption application in multiple
steps and mounts multiple attacks on it. A writeup for the tutorial is available
at https://book.tockos.org/.

Specific abilities of this version:

* Does NOT activate the "fault all applications driver"

This version of the application is essentially just a scaffold to build from
while following the tutorial.
