# UDP Receive Functionality 

Please refer to the README in the above directory for a general Tock/OpenThread overview
and guide to setting up the OpenThread app.

_NOTE: there is on occassion strange behavior if the port is not correctly closed. If this 
occurs it is best to restart the thread network (i.e. `thread stop` reboot device and 
reinitialize the network)_. This is due to strange behavior with the OpenThread CLI 
on the nordic device.

## Tock UDP Receive Demonstration

On initialization, the ipaddr is printed to the Tock console.

```console 
$ tockloader listen
```

```console
[IPADDR] fe80:0:0:0:e094:2134:8353:928f
```

The above value will be unique to the given instance (OpenThread generates this from
the EUI-64 upon each initialization). This value is the {TOCK_DEVICE_IPADDR}

We then configure and send packets from the Nordic OpenThread router.

```console 
> udp open
```

```console
> udp connect {TOCK_DEVICE_IPADDR} 1212
```

```console
> udp send hellothere
```

```console 
> udp close
```

```
