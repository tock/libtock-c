LR1110 Test Apps
================

The [LR1110](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-edge/lr1110) is
an integrated LoRa radio with a WiFi access point scanner and a GNSS scanner
built in.

These example apps use the `libtock-c/lr1110` library to implement the
LoRa/WiFi/GNSS functionality. While this library should work with any LR1110
radio, this was developed and tested with the [WM1110 Dev
Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-WM1110-Dev-Kit-p-5677.html).
