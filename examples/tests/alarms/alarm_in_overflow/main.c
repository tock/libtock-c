/*
 * This test registers a "long running" alarm and verifies that the
 * alarm fires at about the time when it's expected to.
 *
 * NOTE: Modify the "MAX_TICKS" macro in "libtock/alarm.c" to
 * test the implementation of libtock_alarm_in_ms without waiting for
 * the alarm to overflow after 2^32 ticks (which is about 36 hours
 * with a 32768Hz oscillator). Example: if you want to simulate the
 * alarm overflowing after a second on a 32768Hz oscillator you can set
 * "MAX_TICKS" to 32768. You can get the frequence of the alarm by calling
 * alarm_internal_frequency.
