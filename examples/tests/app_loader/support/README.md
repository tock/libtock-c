# Python tool to convert TAB to array
=====================================

This python tool converts compiled TAB files into hex arrays
that can be copied into header files. This is useful in testing
the dynamic process loader application. 

Note: Please remember to `make` the application you want to
      convert. Otherwise the tool will output an error message
      saying file not found.
